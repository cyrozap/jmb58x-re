            SPI clock divisor, divided by 2, minus 1. To calculate the SPI base
            clock from a `CLK_DIV` value, use the following equation:
            `SPI base clock = 25 MHz / (2 * (CLK_DIV + 1))`

            To calculate the value of `CLK_DIV` needed to generate a particular
            SPI base clock, use the following equation:
            `CLK_DIV = 25 MHz / (2 * SPI base clock) - 1`

            The minimum and maximum SPI base clocks are 781.25 kHz and 12.5 MHz,
            respectively.

            When this bit is set, `ADDR_LEN` number of bytes will be transmitted
            from the `SPI_ADDRESS` register in the SPI transaction. When this
            bit is cleared, zero bytes will be transmitted from the
            `SPI_ADDRESS` register.

            When this bit is set, a dummy byte with the value zero will be
            transmitted after the address in the SPI transaction. This byte
            counts towards neither the number of address bytes nor the number of
            data bytes. This functionality is useful for commands like
            `RDSFDP (0x5A)`, which require a dummy byte to be transmitted after
            the address.

        SPI address register. The highest eight bits and the lowest two bits of
        this register are all hardwired to zero, so while the SPI controller is
        capable of transmitting up to four bytes from this register, only 24-bit
        addresses aligned to 32-bit word offsets are supported.
