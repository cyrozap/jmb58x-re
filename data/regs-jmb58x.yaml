            SPI clock divisor, divided by 2, minus 1. To calculate the SPI base
            clock from a `CLK_DIV` value, use the following equation:
            `SPI base clock = 25 MHz / (2 * (CLK_DIV + 1))`

            To calculate the value of `CLK_DIV` needed to generate a particular
            SPI base clock, use the following equation:
            `CLK_DIV = 25 MHz / (2 * SPI base clock) - 1`

            The minimum and maximum SPI base clocks are 781.25 kHz and 12.5 MHz,
            respectively.
